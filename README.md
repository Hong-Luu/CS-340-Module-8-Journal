# CS 340 Module Eight Journal
**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

In my first project, I created a CRUD Python module focusing on clear, simple code for create, read, update and delete, and thorough documentation. This approach made the code maintainable and adaptable, essential for long-term project success. In the second project, leveraging this module to connect dashboard widgets to the database brought several advantages, like consistency in data handling and reduced error potential. The modular design also made it easier to update and adapt for future needs.


**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**

As a computer scientist, when approaching problems like the database and dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare, I focus on understanding the client's needs and translating them into technical solutions. This project was different from previous assignments as it involved real-world application and required practical, client-oriented thinking. In the future, I'll use techniques like thorough planning, understanding the client's business, and iterative development. I'll also incorporate testing and feedback to tailor databases to specific client needs, ensuring they are efficient and user-friendly.


**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**

Computer scientists solve problems using technology. They write code, create software, and find new ways to handle information and processes. This matters because their work makes things easier and more efficient in various industries.

In projects like the one for Grazioso Salvare, my work helps the company work better by organizing their data and making it easy to use. This means they can find information faster, make better decisions, and manage their work more efficiently. My work helps them focus on their main job without worrying about data problems.
