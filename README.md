# CS 340 Module Eight Journal
**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

In my first project, I created a CRUD Python module focusing on clear, simple code for create, read, update and delete, and thorough documentation. This approach made the code maintainable and adaptable, essential for long-term project success. In the second project, leveraging this module to connect dashboard widgets to the database brought several advantages, like consistency in data handling and reduced error potential. The modular design also made it easier to update and adapt for future needs.


**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?**


As a computer scientist, I carefully planned and worked on Grazioso Salvare's project, focusing on what they needed. This was different from other school work because it was more about real situations and working with a client. In the future, I'll plan well and test a lot to make databases that fit what clients want.


**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?**


Computer scientists like me help solve problems with technology. My work helps companies like Grazioso Salvare manage their information better and make smarter decisions, which is very important for their success.
